#### Software engineer with a passion for robotics and systems programming.

Experience
---------
**Senior Software Engineer, Nvidia** (2022-Present, Boston MA)

- Perception/ML Infrastructure engineer supporting development of offline KPI processes to better access performance of Rules of Road perception end to end pipeline.
- Nvidia Engineering Lead for Error Handling and Degradation system for Nvidia/Mercedes Level 2 Driving product.  Led the development of dashboarding and data analysis pipelines, oversaw triaging efforts and tooling for fleet degradation events, drove performance and logging improvements for the error handling pipeline, supported compliance efforts for certification standards such as the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), and assisted in developing automated and on-vehicle test procedures and frameworks for demonstrating critical safety features.
- Developed middleware components to support data passing for a Level 3 product leveraging a dual-compute system. Integrated perception and calibration components for initial product bring-up, and created integration and system-level testing to catch regressions and support the development of new features.

**Robotics Systems Engineer, Optimus Ride** (2019-2022, Boston MA)

- Lead Networking Software Engineer responsible for enhancing message-passing performance and middleware features for a multi-compute autonomy system. Developed lidar sensor drivers and monitoring applications, supporting performance improvements to data decoders and time synchronization between compute and sensors.
- Led integration efforts for a custom compute platform, interfacing with hardware and software teams to resolve issues and conduct software performance analysis. Maintained system architecture diagrams, performed Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) on the new compute platform, and drove improvements to hardware and software safety monitoring systems based on FMEA results.

**Senior Member of Technical Staff, Draper** (2014-2019, Cambridge MA)

- Software developer for flight computer python based automated testing system.
- Deputy technical directory of embedded sensor node programs.
- Embedded software developer for test firmware for embedded sensor node programs.
