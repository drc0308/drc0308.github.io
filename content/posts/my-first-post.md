## Trying this blogging thing again...  

So my 2024 ended in quite an unfortunate way. After a year that started off incredibly with a wonderful trip to Australia and New Zealand, crossing off a lifelong dream from my bucket list, it ended with me having my biggest medical scare to date.  

It was a confusing time, to say the least. It started as what I thought was just a stomach bug, then I thought maybe it was E. coli, but what was hopefully a quick trip to the ER quickly ballooned. After a long night of blood tests, stool tests, a CT scan, and a bombardment of questions regarding symptoms, medical history, and then a sigmoidoscopy, _the younger sibling to a colonoscopy_, they landed on a diagnosis. **Ulcerative Colitis.** It was then a long two weeks of getting stable and on a treatment plan that could continue outpatient, but I made it home just in time for the new year.  

## So what is it?  

Ulcerative Colitis is interesting. I've learned a lot about it in the last month through conversations with my gastroenterologist, [The Mayo Clinic book](https://order.store.mayoclinic.com/flex/mmv/CRNUC01/?utm_source=MC-DotOrg-PS&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=CrohnsColitis-Book&utm_content=CROHN), and talking with other people who have this condition.  
It's chronic, autoimmune, and the only "real cure" is the removal of the colon. (_If you call that a cure._)  
As you can imagine, all of this was quite overwhelming at first, and I felt quite in the dumps.  

However, after taking some time to educate myself and having long conversations with my medical team, I changed my tune. It's going to be a struggle for a bit, but there are lots of different medications that have helped bring people into remission and lead normal lives. Until then, I'll be futzing around with some new recipes. Thankfully, there are great resources such as [The Crohn's Colitis Diet Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Crohns-Colitis-Diet-Guide-Recipe) and [IBD-AID](https://www.umassmed.edu/nutrition/ibd/ibdaid/), which have helped to get over the fear of what to eat and take it a bit easy while I get back to normal.  

So I've got a bit more free time on my hands as I'm at home a bit...  

## Okay, so what are you going to blog about and why are you blogging?  

I don't plan on turning this blog into just me rambling about my newfound chronic conditionâ€”albeit it will be the subject at times. _I apologize in advance for any rants on the American healthcare system_.  What I do want to do is start writing a bit about my experience, regardless of whether anyone reads it. So, in case anyone does stumble upon this, they can have a bit of insight into what goes on in the life of someone with a chronic inflammatory bowel disease.  

So think of this more as a self-motivation tool. I'm going to share what I'm doing with my life. I plan to highlight some of my personal projects (stay tuned for some silly ideas), discuss some of my hobbies (chess, reading, hiking, sports), and other random things that interest me. Also, writing is fun, and I used to do a lot of it in my free time during high school and college. It's something I've grown to miss.  

Regardless, this is a low-pressure chance for me to write about a handful of things I'm picking up in my free time. So stay tuned!
